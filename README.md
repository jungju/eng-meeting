# eng-meeting

Personalized English learning site focused on real-world meeting and work scenarios.

## Overview

**eng-meeting** is a personal English learning project designed to solve one specific problem:

> *How can I keep studying English consistently, using situations I actually face at work?*

Instead of generic lessons, this project focuses on **realistic meeting and workplace conversations**, especially in **medical, hospital, and IT environments**.

The site is actively used and continuously improved based on real usage.
It is also used by my daughter, which helps keep the UX simple and sustainable.

## Why Svelte?

This project changes frequently as learning needs evolve.
Svelte was chosen because:

- Less code compared to React or Vue
- Clear and simple component structure
- Faster development and iteration
- Very efficient when combined with AI-generated or AI-assisted code

For a solo developer maintaining a living product, this productivity difference matters a lot.
