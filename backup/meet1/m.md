Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this meeting. My name is John, and I manage the hospital’s IT department. We are excited to discuss the installation of your new diagnostic imaging equipment.

Good morning, John. I am Sarah, the lead developer from MedTech Solutions. We are looking forward to working with your team on this project.

Hello, Sarah. I am Dr. Lee, and I oversee the radiology department here. We have been anticipating this new system to improve patient imaging services.

Good morning, everyone. I am Emily, a technician from MedTech Solutions. I will handle the hardware installation and initial setup.

Could you give us a quick overview of the medical device you will be installing?

Of course. We are installing a state-of-the-art imaging machine that integrates with our cloud-based software. It captures high-resolution images and sends them securely to a central server for analysis.

That sounds great. How will the images be stored, and do we need additional data storage solutions?

We use AWS Cloud for long-term storage. This allows secure access and enables easy retrieval of patient data from anywhere in the hospital network.

John (Hospital IT Manager): Our hospital network uses a secure VPN and firewall. Are there any special network requirements we need to set up before the installation?

Emily (Technician, MedTech Solutions): We will need access to a secure port for image data transfer. I will send you a list of required ports and firewall rules. Also, we recommend at least a 1 Gbps connection in the imaging suite to ensure fast data upload.

John (Hospital IT Manager): That’s good to know. We can coordinate with our network administrator to open those ports and confirm bandwidth availability.

John (Hospital IT Manager): How long do you estimate the installation process will take?

Emily (Technician, MedTech Solutions): The physical setup takes about one day. After that, we usually need two or three days for software configuration and testing.

Dr. Lee (Head of Radiology): Will our radiology staff need training once it is installed?

Sarah (Lead Developer, MedTech Solutions): Yes. We provide on-site training sessions. Typically, it takes two days to train your key staff members, and we can schedule follow-up support sessions if needed.

John (Hospital IT Manager): Once the equipment is installed, how do we verify that everything is working properly?

Emily (Technician, MedTech Solutions): We have a standard checklist. We will run test scans, check image quality, and validate data transfer to the AWS Cloud. After everything passes our tests, we will ask the hospital team to confirm the results.

Dr. Lee (Head of Radiology): That sounds thorough. Our radiologists will be ready to review the test images.

John (Hospital IT Manager): So, the next steps: Emily, you will share the network requirements, and we will coordinate with our network team. After that, we can schedule the installation date. Sarah, you will provide the training schedule once we confirm the installation timeline.

Sarah (Lead Developer, MedTech Solutions): Exactly. We will send a detailed plan for both installation and training by the end of this week.

Dr. Lee (Head of Radiology): Perfect. Thank you for organizing everything, John.

John (Hospital IT Manager): Thank you, everyone. I believe that covers our main topics. If there are no further questions, we can adjourn the meeting.

Emily (Technician, MedTech Solutions): No further questions from me. I am looking forward to working with you all.

Sarah (Lead Developer, MedTech Solutions): Me too. Thank you for your time.

Dr. Lee (Head of Radiology): Likewise. Have a great day!
